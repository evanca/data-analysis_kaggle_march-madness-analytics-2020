### Introduction
This repository holds the **winning submission for a 2020 Google Cloud & NCAA® March Madness Analytics Competition**.

Each season there are thousands of men's and women's NCAA® basketball games played between Division I teams, culminating in March Madness®, the national championship tournaments that start in the middle of March [[1]](https://evanca.github.io/data-analysis_kaggle_march-madness-analytics-2020/). The men's and women's NCAA basketball tournaments are beloved American sports traditions. These are single-elimination tournaments, which means that the championship team has to win at least six games in a row to claim the title. This high-stakes environment — plus the chance to witness a crazy "Cinderella-story" upset, gives the tournament its March Madness® nickname [[4]](https://evanca.github.io/data-analysis_kaggle_march-madness-analytics-2020/).

The challenge of the "Google Cloud & NCAA® March Madness Analytics" competition, sponsored by Google Cloud and hosted by Kaggle, was to present an exploratory analysis of the March Madness® using a Kaggle Notebook.
